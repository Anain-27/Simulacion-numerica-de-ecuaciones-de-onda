	abstract = {In this paper the algorithm based on SVM (Support Vector Machines) for determining of effectiveness of test drug is proposed. The most time-consuming tasks of medicine include diagnosing and choosing a course of treatment. Traditionally, doctors have solved these problems, relying only on their own intuition and experience. Today in their arsenal are increasingly included methods based on high technology and allowing to process large flows of information. Mathematical description and formulation of the problem are given. The results of experiments based on the algorithm are presented. The main goal of the paper is to create prerequisites for preventive diagnosis of tuberculosis patients. Using the proposed model and monitoring system, specialists can correctly diagnose and develop an optimal treatment course.}

Results obtained through re-substitution, jackknife, and independent data set tests, respectively, have indicated that the SVM approach is quite a promising one, suggesting that the covariant discriminant algorithm (Chou and Elrod, Protein Eng. 12 (1999) 107) and SVM, if effectively complemented with each other, will become a powerful tool for predicting membrane protein types and the other protein attributes as well.}

	abstract = {The advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the petroleum industry has seen an increase in its use in exploration, development, production, reservoir engineering and management planning to accelerate decision making, reduce cost and time. Supervised machine learning has gained much popularity in establishing a relationship between complex non-linear datasets. This type of machine learning algorithm has showcased its superiority over petroleum engineering regression techniques in terms of prediction errors for high dimensional data, computational power and memory. This review focuses on the most widely used machine learning algorithm employed in the petroleum industry, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with different shallow models used in reservoir characterisation. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Relevant Vector Machine (RVM) has over the years emerged as competitive algorithms where in most cases based on this review it outperformed the ANN. This makes it preferable than the ANN when there are limited data sets. Finally, hybridisation of multiple algorithms methodologies also showed improved performance over singularly applied algorithms offering a pathway in improving reservoir characterisation based on supervised machine learning as future scope of work.}

	abstract = {We describe a new classification methodology based on binary classifiers constructed using support vector machines and applying a one-versus-all approach supported by the use of the directed acyclic graphs. The new methodology, which is computationally less costly because a smaller number of binary classification problems have to be resolved, was validated using UCI Machine Learning Repository data sets. Results point to the improved performance of the proposed model compared to approaches based on the one-versus-one and directed acyclic graph techniques. This new multiclassification strategy successfully applied to a slate tile classification problem produced favourable results compared to other validated techniques.}
